# Hello!! 
I'm Arthur Luiz, brazilian game developer and creator this game "Sunny Land". That is my first game 2D than i developed on Unity Engine.

For a development this game, i was inspired by Snes and Mega Drive plataform games. So for development this game, i include mechanics to:

-Basics Movements;

-Jumps and duble jumps;

-Catch coins (carrot) and life (Star);

-Patrolling enemies;

-Stalkers enemies;

-Doors Keys;

-Traps;

-Stage Select;

-Boss Battle;

# Controlls
Moves: Arrow Keys;

Spacebar: Jump & double Jump.


The moment i publish this repository, the game has 3 phases, the last being a boss battle. I took almost 2 mounths to finish this game, it was hard for a rookie one, but i loved developer it, it's served for experience for Work.
